Data Binding - Automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components.
The model is the single-source-of-truth for the application state.
The view is a instant projection of the model at all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.
This avoids active manipulation of the DOM and supports bootstrapping and rapid development of web applications.
$scope service in Angular, detects changes to the model and modifies HTML in the view accordingly.
Any modification in the view are updated in the model via controller in the same way.

Controllers add data and methods to $scope as properties
HTML elements select a controller
with ng-controller attribute
in effect for the element and its descendants
Form elements bind to $scope properties
with ng-model attribute
Binding expressions access data and methods
on $scope of their controller
expressions in double-curly braces {{ }} that appear in HTML attribute values and element content
When JavaScript code changes value of a $scope property ...
form elements that refer to them with ng-model are updated
binding expressions that refer to them are updated
When user changes value of an form element ...
$scope property referred to by the ng-model attribute is updated
